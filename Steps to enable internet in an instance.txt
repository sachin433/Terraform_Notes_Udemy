To enable access to or from the internet for instances in a subnet in a VPC, you must do the following:

Attach an internet gateway to your VPC.

Add a route to your subnet's route table that directs internet-bound traffic to the internet gateway. 
If a subnet is associated with a route table that has a route to an internet gateway, it's known as a public subnet. 
If a subnet is associated with a route table that does not have a route to an internet gateway, it's known as a private subnet.

Ensure that instances in your subnet have a globally unique IP address (public IPv4 address, Elastic IP address, or IPv6 address).

Ensure that your network access control lists and security group rules allow the relevant traffic to flow to and from your instance.

In your subnet route table, you can specify a route for the internet gateway to all destinations not explicitly known to the route table (0.0.0.0/0 for IPv4 or ::/0 for IPv6). 
Alternatively, you can scope the route to a narrower range of IP addresses; for example, the public IPv4 addresses of your companyâ€™s public endpoints outside of AWS, or the Elastic IP addresses of other Amazon EC2 instances outside your VPC.

To enable communication over the internet for IPv4, your instance must have a public IPv4 address or an Elastic IP address that's associated with a private IPv4 address on your instance. 
Your instance is only aware of the private (internal) IP address space defined within the VPC and subnet. 
The internet gateway logically provides the one-to-one NAT on behalf of your instance, so that when traffic leaves your VPC subnet and goes to the internet, the reply address field is set to the public IPv4 address or Elastic IP address of your instance, and not its private IP address. 
Conversely, traffic that's destined for the public IPv4 address or Elastic IP address of your instance has its destination address translated into the instance's private IPv4 address before the traffic is delivered to the VPC.
